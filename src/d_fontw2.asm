; Comment added after generation:
; This and d_fontv2.chr probably won't be used.  They're attempted recreations
; of the pixel font used during Celeste's development (a lot of it can be seen
; in the January 2017 version shown in "Celeste Developer Commentary Livestream")
;
; I probably won't use this in favor of d_font.chr / d_fontw.asm, which are my
; homegrown versions.

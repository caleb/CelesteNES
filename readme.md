# Celeste NES

^^ working title.

This is an attempt to port *[Celeste](https://celestegame.com)* to the Nintendo
Entertainment System / Family Computer, led by iProgramInCpp.

Currently this is a massive work in progress. This means that the game may be
either:
- buggy,
- unstable,
- or downright broken.

If you see this, you were probably added to the CelesteNES repository by
iProgramInCpp. Keep these in mind if you want to commit:

- Ping me in the relevant discord channel when you're going to commit something.
	This allows me to check out your changes. I will **revert** your changes if
	I think something is wrong and I won the argument against it.

- DO NOT, under any circumstances, **force push** over my changes.  I will be
  able to revert it, but if that happens, you will certainly be kicked off.

- In the event that I decide to publish the source code to this game when I finish,
  the commit log will be reset.

- That's it. Enjoy! :)

One more thing, until I announce otherwise, do not post compiled ROMs or source
code of this game. Also keep previews to a minimum, I want this project to stay
low-key until I'm nearly done.

this probably won't be the case.
